Firstly My Favourite Dish Is Grilled Sandwich. Let's make it.
1. Firstly buy sandwich bread, vegetables (capsicum,tomato,cucumber,onion and whatever you wish) and diary prouduct(cheese, milkcream) from market.
2. Now cut the vegetables (capsicum,tomato,cucumber,onion) into small pieces.
3. Add cream.
4. Mix salt and red pepper according to your taste.
5. You can also add finely chopped green chillies in place of red pepper.
6. Cut the cheese equal to the size of the bread but it should be thin.
7. Now put things that we chopped on the bread and then put cheese slice on it.
8. And cover it with another loaf of bread.
9. Grill it.
10. Now you can make how many you want.
             THANK YOU.
